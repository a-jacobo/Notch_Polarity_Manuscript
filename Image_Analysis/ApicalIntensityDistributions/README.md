Created by Adrian Jacobo and Anna Erzberger.

Files are organized in three folders:

* __Bifurcation_Diagrams__: Auto07p and Python 2.7 scripts to calculate and plot the bifurcation diagrams presented in the paper.
* __Simulations__: Python 2.7 code to simulate the equations used in the paper.
* __Image_Analysis__: Fiji scripts to used to quantify the images for the paper.

For more details on the equations refer to the methods section.
